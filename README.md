# K Means full Python implementation

Full Python Implementation of the K Means algorithm using python (for .wav file compression)

input: .wav file ,  .txt file with the k initial centroids
output: output.txt of the updated centroids, compressed.wav - the compressed .wav file , graph of the cost as a function of the iteration

to run the progrum use the following code:

# $ python ex_1.py <wav_file_path> <centroinds_init_path>

For example:

# $ python ex_1.py sample.wav cents1.txt

You can use the cents1.txt , sample.wav files included in the repository.
